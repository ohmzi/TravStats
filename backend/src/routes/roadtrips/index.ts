/**
 * Roadtrips (design 2026-09-24). A roadtrip is a `TripRoute` with
 * `kind = "roadtrip"`: this router owns only what is new — the list, the
 * detail with stations and their stays, creation, and the station list
 * (`./stations.ts`). Everything a roadtrip shares with a tour — legs,
 * routing, tracks, geometry, rename, delete — is served by the kind-agnostic
 * `/tours/:routeId/*` family, which is the point of one engine.
 *
 * Middleware is PER ROUTE, never `router.use()`: a router-level
 * `authenticate` mounted at `/api/v1` would swallow every later mount's
 * requests (the phase-1 bug that 401'd the public pairing endpoints).
