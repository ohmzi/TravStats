/**
 * Validation for the tour endpoints.
 *
 * Two DIFFERENT vocabularies, because two DIFFERENT endpoints write this
 * column and they have different capabilities:
 *
 * - `ACCEPTED_LEG_SOURCES` — what `tripRouteLegs.source` may hold at rest:
 *   `straight` (the default chord), `drawn` (a hand-drawn override, phase
 *   1), `routed` (a provider-computed line, phase 3 — written only by
 *   `routes/trips/tourRouting.ts`, never by the manual override endpoint
 *   below), and `track` (phase 3b, task 5 — a leg that adopted a segment
 *   of a recorded `TripRouteTrack`, written only by the manual override
 *   endpoint's `track` branch below via `adoptSegment`).
 * - `MANUAL_LEG_SOURCES` — what the PLAIN (non-track) shape of the manual
 *   leg-override endpoint (`PUT .../legs/{fromStopId}/{toStopId}` in
 *   `routes/trips/tourLegs.ts`) accepts from a caller: `straight` and
 *   `drawn` only. `routed` geometry comes from a provider, not a request
 *   body — a caller cannot hand-supply it, so this endpoint refuses it
 *   with a message pointing at the routing endpoint instead. This is
 *   deliberate, not an oversight: earlier this file let the override
 *   endpoint accept `source: "routed"` too, on the theory that a caller
 *   might resend it unchanged while editing an unrelated field (toll
 *   cost, say). That endpoint's semantics were never built to preserve
 *   stored geometry on a re-submit — an omitted `waypoints` clears the
 *   column for EVERY source — so accepting `routed` there let a caller
 *   produce a leg that claimed `source: "routed"` while holding a plain
 *   straight chord: a false provenance claim, worse than either honest
 *   state. Splitting the vocabulary closes that path: the override
 *   endpoint can no longer put the column into that shape at all.
 *
 *   `track` does NOT join `MANUAL_LEG_SOURCES` even though the override
 *   endpoint now accepts it (see `legOverrideSchema` below): a bare
 *   `{ source: "track" }` with no `trackId` would be a leg claiming track
 *   geometry it does not have — exactly the false-provenance failure the
 *   `routed` split above was created to prevent, one level down. Instead
 *   `legOverrideSchema` is a discriminated union: the `MANUAL_LEG_SOURCES`
 *   shape for `straight`/`drawn`, and a SEPARATE shape for `track` that
 *   requires `trackId`. `ACCEPTED_LEG_SOURCES` still gains `track` because
 *   a stored row may legitimately hold it once adopted.
 *
 * A source the server cannot (yet, or ever, from THIS endpoint) produce is
 * rejected at the boundary instead of being stored and rendered as a lie.
