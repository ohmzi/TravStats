/**
 * The airport-derived fields every flight read path owes its callers.
 *
 * A flight row stores UTC plus time semantics; since ADR 0002 phase 2 it also
 * stores the zone each end was written with, which wins. Rows written before
 * that carry none, and rendering them in their airport's clock needs the
 * catalogue. The
 * same lookup answers three more questions for free: which countries the flight
 * touched, which city each end sits in, and how long it actually took once both
 * zones are accounted for.
 *
 * THIS LIVES IN ONE PLACE BECAUSE IT ALREADY DRIFTED. The list endpoint
 * enriched, the single-flight endpoint did not, and the flight detail page —
 * which shares its time component with the list — silently fell back to UTC:
 * a Munich departure of 12:16 read "10:16 UTC" on its own page while the list
 * and the trip timeline both said 12:16. A read path that returns flights to a
 * client calls this; adding one that does not brings the bug back.
