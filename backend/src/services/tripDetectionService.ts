/**
 * Trip auto-detection — runs heuristics over a user's existing trip-less
 * flights and groups them into trips. Designed for bulk-import flows
 * (xlsx, CSV, AI-agent batch) and as a recovery path for legacy data.
 *
 * Philosophy (since the trip-selection overhaul): a Trip is a container
 * for a real JOURNEY, not a mirror of a booking. A plain out-and-back
 * booking (2 legs) does not need a trip — flights are first-class
 * without one. Every heuristic therefore only proposes clusters of at
 * least MIN_TRIP_FLIGHTS (3) flights ("Rule of Three"); smaller groups
 * stay trip-less. Users can always create a trip manually.
 *
 * Heuristic stack (in order — first match wins per flight):
 *   1. PNR cluster — flights sharing `bookingReference`, group span <= 30
 *      days. The 30-day cap drops frequent-flyer-IDs (e.g. literal
 *      "WITTKE" appearing on a year of unrelated bookings) that the
 *      original /flights/batch heuristic would falsely glue together.
 *      → AUTO-LINK (intent is unambiguous: shared PNR = shared booking).
 *
 *   2. Home loop — sequences that start and end at one of the user's home
 *      airports (the set active at that date, so historical home moves
 *      are respected, and CGN → … → DUS closes a loop for someone who
 *      flies from both). Catches the Hawaii 2013 case (HNL→LIH→KOA→OGG
 *      over 3 weeks with separate carriers and PNRs but a clear MUC→…→MUC
 *      shape).
 *      → PROPOSE (caller decides whether to commit).
 *
 *   3. Continuity sliding window — consecutive flights where the previous
 *      arrival IATA equals (or is co-located with, "open jaw") the next
 *      departure IATA, and the ground gap is <= 7 days. 7d is the
 *      conservative midpoint between Gemini's 3-7d recommendation and
 *      the Hawaii loop's 3-day inter-island layovers.
 *      → PROPOSE.
 *
 * Cancelled-leg suppression: rows with the same (dep_iata, departure
 * date) as another row in the cluster are de-duplicated before grouping
 * — typically these are rebooked legs the user logged twice.
 *
 * Orphan cleanup: at the end, trips with zero linked flights are
 * deleted in the same transaction. Catches state from earlier failed
 * import iterations that left empty trips behind.
