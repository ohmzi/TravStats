/**
 * Tours are ONE domain with ONE colour (owner, 2026-09-05). The means of
 * transport changes the icon, never the hue — the web ran five colours for
 * train, hiking, cycling, road and ferry, and they fall with this constant.
 *
 * Not a member of `DOMAINS`: a tour is not a domain in the gating sense — it
 * has no `enabledDomains` entry, no route prefix of its own and no parser
 * target. It is a colour the map and the legend both need, and this is the one
 * place it is written. Mirrors `domainColor.tour` in `design/tokens.json` and
 * `--ts-domain-tour` in the generated theme. Since round 29 (2026-09-26) it
 * equals the roadtrip default — one "road" hue; the map tells a tour from a
 * roadtrip by its thinner line (`tourMapOverlay.tsx`).
 *
 * Since 2026-10-08 it is the ACCENT rather than the moss it was (owner): the
 * travelled line is the same yellow as the primary action, on the trip map and
 * on the cards alike, so one colour says "this is the way the journey went"
 * wherever it is drawn. `design/tokens.json` still carries the moss as
 * `domainColor.tour`; that is a design-system edit this change does not make on
 * its own, and the two would need reconciling there.

 * A v1 value equal to one of these is that frozen default, not a choice.
