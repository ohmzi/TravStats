 * nothing — but simply copying that one across would have tripled a trap
 * rather than fixing an asymmetry. `LodgingStatStrip` renders the backend's
 * own rollup over the WHOLE library, deliberately and for a good reason (it
 * cannot drift from `/stats/lodging`). Above a filtered table it therefore
 * contradicts the table: total spend for 60 hotels, over seven rows, next to
 * a filter-aware "7 angezeigt" in the bar.
 *
 * So this is a different thing with a different promise, and the promise is in
 * the name: it summarises the LIST, and it is computed from exactly the rows
 * the list is showing. The authoritative totals keep their home in the
 * dashboard, where nothing is filtered underneath them.
 *
 * Kept to a handful of figures that read straight off a row. Anything
 * estimated — flight time and distance are both derived, and the app is
 * careful to mark them as estimates wherever they appear — has no business
 * being silently summed into a headline number.
