 * Turns the geometry endpoint's output into `PathLayer` data.

 * Every leg is the tour colour. This file used to hold five — one per means of
 * transport — with a comment arguing that "a colour is a claim about how a leg
 * was travelled", which is why an unrecognised mode got a neutral grey rather
 * than borrowing road's green. The owner settled it differently on 2026-09-05:
 * tours are ONE domain with ONE colour, and the means of transport is carried
 * by the ICON. The concern the five colours answered dissolves with them — a
 * hue that says nothing about the mode cannot make a false claim about it.
 *
 * `isPlaceholder` stays, and it is a different kind of statement: a `straight`
 * (unrouted) leg is a chord standing in for a measurement, so `TripMap.tsx`
 * draws it lighter and thinner. That is a claim about the DATA, not about the
 * vehicle, and it survives.
