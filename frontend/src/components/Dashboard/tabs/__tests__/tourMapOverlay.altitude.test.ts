/**
 * Fix round 2 (2026-08-30, browser verification): `/dashboard/tour?mode=
 * routes` drew the tour line correctly; `/dashboard/tour?mode=globe` drew
 * NOTHING under a legend that still claimed five modes were present.
 *
 * Root cause, found in `Globe/buildGlobeLayers.ts`'s own doc comment for
 * `CRUISE_PATH_ALTITUDE_M` (a previously-diagnosed instance of the exact
 * same defect): a 2-D `[lng, lat]` path with no altitude component renders
 * at exactly altitude 0 under MapLibre's globe projection, which shares
 * depth-buffer values with the sphere mesh itself -- every fragment loses
 * the depth test and nothing reaches the screen. Cruise paths already
 * lift 5 km off the surface for this reason; the tour path layer never
 * did, because it had only ever been fed into the flat map before fix
 * round 1 wired `extraLayers` into GlobeView.
 *
 * This test cannot prove pixels appear on a real globe -- that needs an
 * actual WebGL context, which jsdom does not provide, and no test in this
 * suite (before or after this fix) exercises deck.gl's GPU pipeline. What
 * IS provable without WebGL, and is exactly the mechanism that broke, is
 * the DATA `buildTourDeckLayers` hands to the `PathLayer`'s `getPath`
 * accessor: whether it carries a non-zero altitude. A deck.gl `Layer`
 * instance exposes its constructor props (including accessor functions)
 * via `.props` without needing a GPU, which is what this test reads.
