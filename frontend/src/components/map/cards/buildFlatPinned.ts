// Turning a flat-map selection into the shared card's payload.
//
// The globe builds `MapPinned` straight out of its layer datums, because its
// layers already carry the endpoint identity the card wants. The flat map does
// not: its selection lives in the Zustand stores as `Flight` rows, and the
// endpoint country/city only exist on the enriched `/geo` features. So this
// module is the flat map's half of the owner's 2026-09-20 ruling — the adapter
// that lets both surfaces mount the SAME card.
//
// Pure: no React, no stores, no map instance.
