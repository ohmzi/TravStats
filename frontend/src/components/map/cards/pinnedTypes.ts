// What a map card is asked to describe.
//
// The owner ruled on 2026-09-20, with the globe's click card and the flat
// map's five ad-hoc tooltips side by side, that the globe card is the one to
// keep — "Globus soll überall genutzt werden". That makes the card map chrome,
// not globe chrome, so the payload it reads has to be the intersection both
// renderers can supply rather than the globe's layer datum.
//
// Every shape here is a SUBSET of the globe's own `globeLayerTypes.ts` datums
// (`ArcDatum`, `PointDatum`, `CruisePathDatum`), which is what lets `GlobePinned`
// stay assignable to `MapPinned` with no cast and no change on the globe side.
// Widening a field here is therefore not free: it has to stay something the
// globe layer datum already carries.
