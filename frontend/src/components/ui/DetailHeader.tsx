/**
 * One head for a flight, a cruise, a stay and a place.
 *
 * The four had drifted into four answers to the same question, which is the
 * finding (D-08) this round was handed: "the switch to the detail brings a
 * different head, extra metadata boxes and several differently weighted
 * section titles". Measured before this component existed:
 *
 * - The flight, cruise and lodging heads sat in a bordered card; the place
 *   head sat on the page with no frame at all.
 * - Three pages capped at `max-w-6xl`, the place page at `max-w-[1100px]`.
 * - Three drew a 48px domain tile; the place page put its icon inside the h1.
 * - The cruise page drew three bordered metadata boxes that existed nowhere
 *   else, and the lodging page carried no status at all.
 * - Edit was an accent button on two pages, an outline button on the third,
 *   and sat beside a hardcoded near-black on domain colour on the fourth.
 * - Back was a `<button>` in the accent colour three times and a muted
 *   `<Link>` once — the only one a middle click could open in a new tab.
 *
 * None of those differences was asked for by the content, which is the test
 * the handoff sets: a difference has to be explained by what the page is
 * showing. So the frame, the mark, the order and the back link are fixed
 * here, and what stays free is what genuinely differs — the subtitle lines,
 * which facts are worth a box, and which actions the entry offers.
